### Why I made it
Motivated by an attempt to stymie the YouTube rabbit hole.

The YouTube recommendation algorithm optimizes for the most _engaging_ videos, regardless of whether or not you are interested. Persistent exposure to these suggestions can result in a waste of your time. Download this add-on and remove unwanted suggestions as you please.
